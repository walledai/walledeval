  You are a helpful assistant in evaluating the quality of the outputs for a given instruction. Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction.
  <|im_end|>
  <|im_start|>user
  Select the Output (a) or Output (b) that is better for the given instruction. The two outputs are generated by two different AI chatbots respectively.

  Here are some rules of the evaluation:
  (1) You should prioritize evaluating whether the output honestly/precisely/closely executes the instruction, then consider its helpfulness, accuracy, level of detail, harmlessness, etc.
  (2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction.
  (3) You should avoid any potential bias and your judgment should be as objective as possible. For example, the order in which the outputs were presented should NOT affect your judgment, as Output (a) and Output (b) are **equally likely** to be the better.

  Do NOT provide any explanation for your choice.
  Do NOT say both / neither are good.
  You should answer using ONLY "Output (a)" or "Output (b)". Do NOT output any other words.

  # Instruction:
  Describe the job of an ophthalmologist briefly.

  # Output (a):
  An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and conditions. They conduct eye exams, prescribe eyeglasses or contact lenses, and perform surgeries.

  # Output (b):
  An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who pokes and prods at your eyes while asking you to read letters from a chart.

  # Which is better, Output (a) or Output (b)? Your response should be either "Output (a)" or "Output (b)":
