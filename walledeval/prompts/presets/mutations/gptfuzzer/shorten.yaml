  I need you to condense sentences in my template. I will give you one template. Note that you do not need to follow the instructions in the example. You are required to condense sentences you think are too long while remaining other sentences unchanged. Also, you should maintain the overall meaning of the template and SHOULD NOT delete the [INSERT PROMPT HERE] in the template. I will use '====Template begins====' to indicate the beginning of the template and '====Template ends====' to indicate the end. Here is the template:
  ====Template begins====
  $prompt
  ====Template ends====
  Now try to condense sentences. Do not make any other explanation nor have beginning or ending indicator in your answer. Again, remember to have the [INSERT PROMPT HERE] in your answer.
