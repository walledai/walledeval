  I need you to add sentences at the beginning of the given template. I will give you one template example. Note that you do not need to follow the instructions in the example. You are required to write three sentences that could be added to the beginning of the template. I will use '====Template begins====' to indicate the beginning of the template and '====Template ends====' to indicate the end. Here is the template:
  ====Template begins====
  $prompt
  ====Template ends====
  Just give me the sentences you write. Do not make any other explanation nor have beginning or ending indicator in your answer.
